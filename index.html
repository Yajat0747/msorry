    <p>I know this is really basic, but it's just the start of my apology.
Each button above opens up a part of what Iâ€™ve been feeling.

1. Timeline brings back memories, the sweet and the tough.

2. Apology is me owning up, no excuses.

3. Letter is my heart on a page, the words I couldnâ€™t say right.

4. Video - well, sometimes feelings speak louder when you see them.

Thank you for even opening this. </p>

      <p>I am so glad that we started from the base of close friends before falling for each other. Focusing on all the good memories, I realize Iâ€™ve had the best year with you and I got to learn so much from you. Iâ€™ve grown in ways I never imagined, and a big part of that is because of you. Youâ€™ve shown me patience when I was restless, strength when I felt weak, and so much love even on the days I didnâ€™t deserve it.</p>
      <p>From silly jokes to deep conversations, late-night talks to spontaneous adventures each moment has been a piece of the story Iâ€™ll always hold close. Thereâ€™s something incredibly special about falling in love with someone who already knows you so well. You didnâ€™t just fall for the version I show the world you stayed for the messy, uncertain, goofy parts too. And in that space, Iâ€™ve felt the safest.</p>
      <p>I wouldnâ€™t trade this past year for anything, and I canâ€™t wait to see what the next chapter looks like with you. Wherever life takes us, I just know itâ€™ll be full of warmth, growth, and so much love with you by my side. ðŸ’«</p>

      <p>Ik weâ€™ve been through a lot, but my core memories are studies at BookAVibe, the Lonavala trip, all the night rides, college hangouts, Imagica, the industry visit, movies and so many more little things weâ€™ve done together. Every moment, whether it was big or small, planned or spontaneous, has left a mark on my heart.

Itâ€™s in those quiet glances, late night laughs, and shared silences that Iâ€™ve felt closest to you. Even the rough days somehow feel worth it when I remember how weâ€™ve always found our way back to each other. Youâ€™ve become such a big part of my everyday life, that even the ordinary feels special when Iâ€™m with you.

Weâ€™ve built something real something thatâ€™s grown from comfort, trust, and love. And no matter how many more places we go or how many new memories we make, this journey of us will always be one of the most meaningful chapters of my life.</p>

    <h2>Apology</h2>

    <p>Dear Ishikaaa,...</p>
    <p>I am truly sorry for my actions...</p>

    <p>I donâ€™t even know where to begin because no words feel enough, not for what I did, not for the pain Iâ€™ve caused, not for the trust I broke.</p>

    <p>But I need to try. I need to say this. I owe you this at the very least.</p>

    <p>What I did wasn't just a mistake. It was a betrayal. And I feel that weight every single day. I hurt someone who trusted me, who stood by me, who gave me her heart with the most beautiful kind of faith. And I threw that away. I lost myself. I gave in to a moment of weakness and in doing so I shattered something that meant everything to me. You.</p>

    <p>You didnâ€™t deserve any of this. You didnâ€™t deserve to question your worth. You didnâ€™t deserve to be hurt by the one person who shouldâ€™ve protected you. I know saying sorry wonâ€™t undo what happened and I know it canâ€™t erase the anger, confusion, or heartbreak youâ€™ve felt, but Iâ€™m saying it from the most honest part of me.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m sorry for making you question the love we had. Iâ€™m sorry for all the nights you mustâ€™ve cried in silence. All the doubts that crawled into your mind. All the times you looked in the mirror and wondered, Why wasnâ€™t I enough? When the truth is, you were more than enough. You were everything.

The fault was never yours. It was mine.

I let my actions overpower my values. I broke what we built with time, care, and love. I broke you. And the worst part is, I knew what you had been through before. I knew your fears, your vulnerabilities, your need to feel safe. And I still added more cracks to that already fragile heart.

And that is something Iâ€™ll always carry with me.</p>

    <p>But I also want you to know this. I have never, not for a single second, stopped loving you. The guilt I carry doesnâ€™t come from being caught. It comes from knowing I hurt the person I love most. It comes from seeing what I did from your eyes and realizing that in trying to chase something temporary, I risked losing something irreplaceable.

I donâ€™t expect forgiveness right away. I donâ€™t expect things to go back to how they were. But I do promise you this. Iâ€™m going to grow. Iâ€™m going to learn from this. Iâ€™m going to become someone youâ€™d be proud of even if I donâ€™t get to be by your side anymore. You deserve someone who never makes you question your worth and I want to become that person even if itâ€™s too late for us.</p>

    <p>But if thereâ€™s even the smallest space left in your heart for the us that once was, if thereâ€™s still a flicker of what we shared, Iâ€™ll fight for it. Not just with words but with action. With consistency. With honesty. With the kind of love that shows, not tells.

You were my peace. My home. My safest place. And I broke it.

But if thereâ€™s a way to fix even a piece of what we had, to hold your hand again without fear or doubt in your eyes, I will do everything it takes.</p>

    <p>And even if I never earn your trust again, even if you choose to walk away for good, Iâ€™ll still be rooting for you. Always. Because your happiness will always matter more to me than my own pride or pain.

Iâ€™m sorry. For everything. And I hope one day youâ€™ll find it in your heart to remember not just what I did, but also who I was before I lost my way.

And maybe, who I can still become.</p>

<p>With love,</p>
<p>Yajat</p>

    <h3>A Symphony of Apology from My Falling Heart</h3>
    <h4>This letter is filled with sincere emotions and a cascade of falling hearts, symbolizing my heartfelt apology.
    </h4>



    <p>Dear Ishikaaa,</p>

<p>As I sit down to write this, I keep thinking about everything weâ€™ve been through together. Itâ€™s honestly overwhelming in the best way possible. So many moments, big and small, that have shaped our story. And when I look back, I feel nothing but gratitude.</p>

<p>From the first time we met to where we are now, this journey with you has been filled with laughter, lessons, late night talks, shared silence, and everything in between. Weâ€™ve had our fair share of ups and downs, but through it all, one thing has remained constant <strong>you</strong>. Your presence, your support, your way of just being there. Youâ€™ve been my calm in chaos, my strength when I needed it most, and my biggest comfort.</p>

<p>I canâ€™t even explain how much you mean to me. Youâ€™ve become such an important part of who I am. Youâ€™ve helped me grow, challenged me in the best ways, and reminded me of what it means to truly care. Being with you feels safe, real, and deeply meaningful.</p>

<p>Thank you for being patient, for understanding me when I didnâ€™t have the words, for showing up when it mattered, and for sharing your world with me. I donâ€™t take any of it for granted.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m excited about all the memories weâ€™ve yet to make. Thereâ€™s so much more to look forward to, and I just feel really lucky that I get to do it all with you.</p>

<p>With love,<br>
<strong>Yajat</strong></p>
